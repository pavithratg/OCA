		 * The rules are different for assignment and method calls (including
		 * constructors) for literals.
		 * 
		 * Java only has 6 literal types: IntegerLiteral, FloatingPointLiteral,
		 * BooleanLiteral, CharacterLiteral, StringLiteral, and NullLiteral.
		 * 
		 * Suffice it to say that integer literals are implicitly downcast to
		 * byte, char,short and int as appropriate during assignment.
		 * 
		 * Implicit narrowing occurs only for byte, char, short, and int.
		 * Remember that it does not occur for long, float, or double. So, this
		 * will not compile: int i = 129L; An integer literal is of type long if
		 * it is suffixed with an ASCII letter L or l (ell); otherwise it is of
		 * type int (ยง4.2.1).
